    					<p>Photographs of Hayat Boumedienne show her transformation from the daughter of a French delivery driver to an armed Islamic extremist.  Turkish authorities believe after arriving in Istanbul, Boumedienne stayed two nights in a hotel. After she left Istanbul, Boumedienne spent four days in another city close to the Syrian border before crossing into the war zone on Thursday, according to Turkish officials.  The same day her partner, Coulibaly, shot and killed a French policewoman. He attacked the Kosher grocery store the following day, and the French authorities announced they were searching for Boumedienne.  But by then, it was too late. Phone records confirmed that the woman who may have vital information about terror networks in Europe was already in Syria.
    					</p>
    					<p>The disclosures came as France deployed 10,000 troops to protect sensitive sites — including Jewish schools and neighborhoods — in the wake of the attacks last week that killed 17 people last week. Brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi, as well as Coulibaly, their friend who claimed ties to Islamic extremists in the Middle East, died Friday in clashes with police.
    					</p>
    					<p>One of the other men believed to be part of the network has been seen driving Boumeddiene's car around Paris in recent days, the two officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation with the media. They cautioned that it was not clear whether the driver was an operative, involved in logistics, or some other, less violent role in the cell.
    					</p>
    					<p>Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the manhunt is urgent because "the threat is still present" after the attacks that began Wednesday with 12 people killed at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo by gunmen the police identified as the Kouachi brothers.

If the French police had been looking for Boumedienne, that would have been flagged to the Spanish but they weren't when she left France before the attacks took place.
						One Turkish official told us that his government is furious that the French did not flag Boumedienne as a possible extremist. But U.S. officials say it's normal to scale back close surveillance of suspects who are deemed less important.

						<p>Paris' Marais district — one of the country's oldest Jewish neighborhoods — was filled with police and soldiers by midday Monday. About 4,700 of the security forces would be assigned to protect France's 717 Jewish schools, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
